# AI Collaboration Framework for XRP Trading System

## üéØ **Purpose**

This framework enables seamless collaboration between multiple AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT, Manus) for distributed development, code review, and continuous improvement of the XRP Trading System. Each AI can work on isolated components while maintaining system coherence and quality standards.

## üèóÔ∏è **Component Distribution Strategy**

### **Primary Component Assignments**

| Component | Primary AI | Secondary Review | Focus Area |
|-----------|------------|------------------|------------|
| **SignalEngine** | Claude | ChatGPT | Signal generation algorithms, statistical analysis |
| **TradeServer** | ChatGPT | Claude | Order execution, exchange integration |
| **FeedServer** | Manus | Claude | Market data ingestion, real-time processing |
| **Monitoring-Server** | Claude | Manus | System health, performance metrics |
| **Risk Management** | ChatGPT | Claude | Risk controls, position management |
| **Strategy Engine** | Claude | ChatGPT | Trading strategies, backtesting |

### **Component Isolation Guidelines**

Each component must be reviewable independently with:
- **Clear interfaces**: Well-defined APIs and data contracts
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Architecture, dependencies, and usage
- **Test coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks
- **Configuration isolation**: Environment-specific settings externalized
- **Dependency mapping**: Clear understanding of inter-component relationships
