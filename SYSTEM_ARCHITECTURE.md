    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GH as GitHub
    participant GA as GitHub Actions
    participant DC as Discord
    participant BH as Bastion Host
    participant PS as Production Server
    
    Dev->>GH: Push code to main
    GH->>GA: Trigger workflow
    GA->>GA: Build .NET application
    GA->>GA: Run tests
    GA->>GA: Create deployment package
    GA->>DC: Send build notification

```

## 🔐 **Security Architecture**

### **Access Control**
- All production access via bastion host (57.181.26.87)
- SSH key-based authentication only
- No direct internet access to production servers
- Encrypted secrets in GitHub Actions

### **Network Topology**
```
Internet → Bastion Host → Production Servers
         ↓
    GitHub Actions (via SSH ProxyJump)
```

## 📱 **Discord Integration Architecture**

### **Current Notifications**
- ✅ Build status (success/failure)
- ✅ Build duration and commit info
- ✅ Links to GitHub Actions logs

### **Enhanced Notifications (Next Phase)**
```json
{
  "deployment_notifications": {
    "service_restart": "🔄 Service {service} restarted on {server}",
    "deployment_success": "✅ {service} deployed successfully to {server}",
    "deployment_failure": "❌ Deployment failed for {service} on {server}",
    "health_check": "💚 All services healthy on {server}"
  },
  "trading_notifications": {
    "trade_executed": "💰 Trade executed: {amount} XRP at {price}",
    "signal_generated": "📊 Trading signal: {signal} for {pair}",
    "risk_alert": "⚠️ Risk threshold exceeded: {details}"
  },
  "system_alerts": {
    "high_latency": "🐌 High latency detected: {latency}ms",
    "connection_lost": "🔌 Exchange connection lost: {exchange}",
    "service_down": "🚨 Service down: {service} on {server}"
  }
}
```

## ⚡ **Performance Specifications**

### **Latency Requirements**
- **Order execution**: < 1ms
- **Signal processing**: < 100μs
- **Market data ingestion**: < 50μs
- **Inter-service communication**: < 10μs

### **Throughput Targets**
- **Orders per second**: 10,000+
- **Market data messages**: 100,000+/sec
- **Signal calculations**: 1,000+/sec

### **Optimization Strategies**
- Native .NET 8.0 compilation (no containers)
- Vertical scaling with large EC2 instances
- NATS for ultra-low latency messaging
- Memory-mapped files for state persistence
- Lock-free data structures

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Observability**

### **Metrics Collection**
```yaml
Application Metrics:
  - Trading latency (p50, p95, p99)
  - Order execution rate
  - Signal generation frequency
  - Error rates and exceptions

System Metrics:
  - CPU usage per core
  - Memory allocation patterns
  - Network I/O and latency
  - Disk I/O patterns

Business Metrics:
  - PnL tracking
  - Risk exposure
  - Market exposure
  - Trading volume
```

### **Alerting Thresholds**
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Service down: 0s tolerance
  - High latency: >10ms sustained
  - Memory leak: >90% usage
  - Disk full: >95% usage

Warning Alerts:
  - Elevated latency: >5ms
  - High CPU: >80% sustained
  - Network issues: >1% packet loss
  - Build failures: Any failure
```

## 🗄️ **Data Architecture**

### **Message Flow**
```
Market Data → FeedServer → NATS → SignalEngine → TradeServer → Exchange
                    ↓
              Monitoring-Server (logging, metrics, alerts)
```

### **State Management**
- **In-memory**: Active positions, orders, signals
- **Persistent**: Trade history, configuration, logs
- **Backup**: S3 for long-term storage and compliance

## 🚀 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Blue-Green Deployment**
1. Deploy to staging slot
2. Run health checks
3. Switch traffic atomically
4. Keep previous version for rollback

### **Rollback Procedure**
```bash
# Automatic backup on each deployment
sudo systemctl stop {service}
sudo mv current failed-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
sudo mv backup-{timestamp} current
sudo systemctl start {service}
```
