# AI Prompt v1.1 - Deployment Testing Phase

**Version**: 1.1  
**Created**: 2025-10-01T04:30:00Z  
**Stage**: Production Deployment Testing  
**Context**: Fixing deployment issues and implementing state management  

## Current Situation
- CI/CD pipelines built and configured
- GitHub secrets configured for all repositories
- Discord notifications partially working
- SignalEngine deployment currently failing
- Bastion host temporarily exposed (security risk)
- Need to implement state management system

## Immediate Tasks
1. Debug SignalEngine deployment failure
2. Implement comprehensive state management
3. Fix security exposure on bastion host
4. Test end-to-end deployment

## Key Resources
- Architecture repo: https://github.com/paulwcunningham/XRP-Trading-System-Architecture
- Current state file: state_management/current_state.json
- Security guide: GITHUB_ACTIONS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md

## Critical Issues
- **HIGH**: SignalEngine workflow failing (YAML syntax issues)
- **CRITICAL**: Bastion host security exposure (port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0)
- **HIGH**: No successful production deployments yet

## Success Criteria
- All repositories deploying successfully to production
- Discord notifications working for all events
- Security properly configured with GitHub Actions IP whitelisting
- State management system operational

## Next Stage
Move to v1.2 for enhanced Discord integration and monitoring setup.
